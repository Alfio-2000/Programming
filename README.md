In this repository you'll find some projects about programming. 
I studied C language during my university studies. I studied at University of Catania, Sicily.
My C teacher was Marco Russo: https://www.dfa.unict.it/corsi/l-30/docenti/uid.MG9SQllRSzAwQSs1WjhpMTN0YkpQWnJLam1SM2RrQS92R3NybUlHZUpUVT0= 

I studied Python's basics independently, through Edoardo Midali's video course on YouTube and Codegrind:
