#Calculate the circle area with ray knownledge.
PI_GRECO=math.pi #1
print("I can calculate the circle area.\n")
r=float(input("Insert the ray:")) #Insert the ray
area=PI_GRECO*r*r
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area:.2f}\n")


#1: In python, constants hasn't an expression such as C. Infact, i didn't write define PI. So, in Python, i must write an HIGH
    #letters to identifier the constants.
